Various diseases can affect the function of the mitral valve, including degenerative mitral valve disease and mitral valve prolapse. These diseases can cause mitral stenosis, in which the valve fails to open fully and thereby obstructs blood flow, and/or mitral insufficiency, in which the mitral valve is incompetent and blood flows passively in the wrong direction. \\\\n     Many patients with heart disease, such as problems with the mitral valve, are intolerant of the trauma associated with open-heart surgery. Age or advanced illness may have impaired the patient&#39;s ability to recover from the injury of an open-heart procedure. Additionally, the high costs are associated with open-heart surgery and extra-corporeal perfusion can make such procedures prohibitive. \\\\n     Patients in need of cardiac valve repair or cardiac valve replacement can be served by minimally invasive surgical techniques. In many minimally invasive procedures, small devices are manipulated within the patient&#39;s body under visualization from a live imaging source like ultrasound, fluoroscopy, or endoscopy. Minimally invasive cardiac procedures are inherently less traumatic than open procedures and may be performed without extra-corporeal perfusion, which carries a significant risk of procedural complications. \\\\n     Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement devices, such as the Medtronic Corevalve or the Edwards Sapien, deliver aortic valve prostheses through small tubes which may be positioned within the heart through the aorta via the femoral artery or through the apex of the heart. However, current cardiac valve prostheses are not designed to function effectively within the mitral valve. Further, current cardiac valve prostheses delivered via a minimally invasive device are often difficult to place correctly within the native valve, difficult to match in size to the native valve, and difficult to retrieve and replace if initially placed incorrectly. Furthermore, the mitral valve differs from the aortic valve in that the shape and anatomy immediately surrounding the valve varies greatly from one side of the valve to the other. One access route for delivering replacement mitral valves requires a transseptal approach. Delivering a replacement valve transseptally imparts limitations on the size of the delivery device and the delivery profile of the replacement valve within the delivery device, and imparts certain flexibility requirements for the replacement valve itself as it is delivered transseptally to the location of the native mitral valve. In some embodiments a sheath passing through a septum should be at most about 24F-28F. \\\\n     Many current minimally invasive valve devices are made from super-elastic Nickel-Titanium alloys. These super-elastic alloys allow high material strains, usually 6%-8%, without permanent deformation. Therefore, the alloys allow the valve devices to be packed into a small 6-10 mm diameter tube for delivery while expanding to around 50 mm within the heart. Current manufacturing methods typically involve cutting the valve prosthesis, at least the expandable anchor portion thereof, from a single tubular element that has a uniform thickness along its length. In these cases, the cut expandable anchor may have the same thickness along its length, and thus may not have varying stiffness along the length of the device. The inability to create an expandable anchor with varying thickness throughout can limit the functionality of different regions of the expandable anchor. Certain regions of the expandable anchor may be limited in what they can be configured to perform by creating the valve from a single tubular element. This can be undesirable if there is a need to create certain functionality in different regions of the expandable anchor that result from the regions have different thicknesses. Similarly, traditional expandable anchors made from a single tubular element do not have overlapping components (radially), wherein overlapping components may help impart additional flexibility to portions of the expandable anchor, and/or allow the expandable anchor to be collapsed to have a smaller delivery profile. Furthermore, in a single-piece construction, strains are limited to the elastic strain limit of the material, which may be too low for some applications. \\\\n     These and other deficiencies in existing approaches are described herein. \\\\n     SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE \\\\n     One aspect of the disclosure is a replacement mitral valve, comprising: a self-expandable anchor comprising a ventricular anchor, a central portion, and an atrial anchor, the self-expandable anchor having a self-expanded configuration in which the ventricular anchor and the atrial anchor are flared radially outward relative to the central portion such that the replacement mitral valve is configured to be secured within a mitral valve orifice, the ventricular anchor having greater stiffness in an axial direction than the atrial anchor when the expandable anchor is in the self-expanded configuration;

This disclosure describes the prostheses in the context of replacement mitral valves, but it is conceivable that the prostheses herein can be used or modified to be used as other replacement heart valves. In some embodiments the replacement heart valves are self-orienting (at least on one side) replacement mitral valves configured to be delivered using minimally invasive techniques. \\\\n     The replacement heart valves herein include an expandable anchor that includes an atrial anchor (e.g., configured to be placed on an atrial side of a mitral valve annulus), a ventricular anchor (e.g., configured to be placed on a ventricular side of a mitral valve annulus), and a central portion axially between the atrial and ventricular anchors. The expandable anchor is adapted to be collapsed towards a collapsed delivery configuration, and is adapted to expand towards an expandable configuration. The replacement heart valves also include a plurality of struts secured to at least one of the central portion, the ventricular anchor, or the atrial anchor, the struts being secured to a plurality of replacement leaflets. The struts can be considered part of the expandable anchor, and in embodiments herein are configured to deform as the rest of the expandable anchor is collapsed. It may be possible to incorporate struts that are not deformable, but which are still secured to the expandable anchor. These types of struts may not be considered part of the expandable anchor but are secured to the expandable anchor. The struts extend distally, that is, towards the ventricular anchor. In the context of replacement mitral valves, the “distal” end of the replacement valve refers to the end of the replacement valve that is to be positioned on the ventricular side of the annulus, while “proximal” end refers to the end of the replacement valve that is to be positioned on the atrial side of the annulus. “Distally” in the context of delivery can be used to refer to a location closer to the left ventricle than the left atrium, while “proximally” is generally used to refer to a location closer to the left atrium than the left ventricle. \\\\n     In some embodiment the expandable anchor is adapted to completely self-expand, and in some embodiments it is configured to be partially self-expanding and partially expand by non-self-expanding influences (e.g., a balloon). The expandable anchors can be made of (or partly made of) a super elastic material such as nitinol. \\\\n     One of the advantages of some of the replacement heart valves herein, and the methods of manufacturing provided herein, is that different regions of expandable anchors can have different physical characteristics that would not have been possible with alternative designs. For example, in some embodiments the expandable anchor is manufactured from two or more separate components of material that are secured together during manufacturing. By securing two or more different components together to create the expandable anchor, different starting materials can be used for the different components, and thus different materials with different properties can be used for different regions of the expandable anchor. The different properties can be chosen to impart desired physical characteristics to different regions of the expandable anchor. \\\\n     When two components are secured together during manufacturing they are considered to be non-integral, or non-monolithic, components. Different portions of the expandable anchor that are made from the same starting material are considered to be integral, or monolithic. For example, a manufacturing step could include cutting a strut and an expandable anchor from different pieces of starting material, and securing them together, and they would be considered non-integral. In some embodiments, when one or more components are secured together, the coupling of the two components can be made so that the two components are rigidly secured at the coupling, or so that the two components can move to some degree at the location of the coupling of the two components (e.g., pivotable). \\\\n     In methods of use, the prostheses described herein can be delivered to a cardiac valve orifice, such as the mitral valve, by using minimally invasive techniques to access the cardiac valve. Access routes and procedures are known, such as making small incisions in the patient&#39;s body and passing the prosthesis through the apex of the heart to, for example, a mitral valve. An additional exemplary access route includes delivering the valve through the venous system and into the left atrium via a transseptal puncture. A transseptal approach can impart size limitations on the delivery and thus the delivery profile of the replacement heart valve. Additionally, a transseptal approach can also impart certain flexibility requirements on the replacement heart valve. The replacement heart valves herein are configured to be collapsed into a delivery configuration so they can fit within a delivery device. The replacement heart valves can be delivered to the treatment site within the delivery device and then deployed from the delivery device. If necessary, the replacement valves can be repositioned, re-sheathed (partially or completely) if necessary, and then re-deployed. \\\\n     When the replacement heart valve has been delivered near the mitral valve, the ventricular anchor can be deployed first in a cardiac chamber, such as the ventricle, and retracted to a seated position against the valve orifice, such as the mitral valve orifice. Then the center portion and atrial anchor portion may be deployed in another cardiac chamber, such as the atrium, wherein the expansion and reconfiguration of the atrial anchor and the central portion sandwiches the valve orifice securely between the anchors that have been deployed on either side of the annulus. Other exemplary aspects of the methods of delivery described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,870,948, issued Oct. 28, 2014 can be incorporated into any of the methods of delivery herein. \\\\n     Replacement heart valves herein are configured to be secured in the native valve orifice by sandwiching the cardiac orifice between ventricular and atrial anchors, which are larger in diameter than the valve orifice, and by applying a radial force from the center portion outward against the cardiac orifice. Additional engagement between the prostheses and cardiac tissue can be added with wire hooks extending from the valve prostheses. \\\\n       FIG. 1  is a perspective view of a portion of an exemplary mitral valve prosthesis in an expanded configuration after an expandable anchor and struts have been secured together. The portion of the replacement valve shown in  FIG. 1  may be referred to as an anchor subassembly, which excludes leaflets and any skirts that may be incorporated into the final replacement valve.  FIG. 1  shows a view from an atrial side to a ventricular side. Expandable anchor  1  includes an atrial anchor  2 , a ventricular anchor  4 , and a central portion  3  therebetween. In this embodiment atrial anchor  2  is configured and adapted to be disposed on an atrial side of a mitral valve orifice, and ventricular anchor  4  is configured and adapted to be disposed on a ventricle side of the mitral valve orifice. In some uses, however, anchor  1  may be implanted so that atrial anchor  2  as shown is positioned on the ventricle side and ventricular anchor  4  is positioned on the atrial side. Three struts  5  are secured to the expandable anchor, and in this embodiment are secured to central portion  3 , and at least a portion of struts  5  are disposed radially inward relative to central portion  3 . Struts  5  are extending, or pointing, towards ventricular anchor  4  and away from atrial anchor  2 . \\\\n     Radially inner surfaces of the expandable anchor and the struts define central opening  6 , which is radially within the expandable anchor. The radially inner surfaces of central portion  3  substantially define the perimeter of central opening  6 . Replacement leaflets, which are not shown in  FIG. 1  for clarity, are secured to struts  5  and are disposed at least partially in central opening  6 , and are configured to control blood flow therethrough. \\\\n     In the expanded configuration shown in  FIG. 1  (which is also an “as-manufactured” configuration), atrial anchor  2  and ventricular anchor  4  extend radially outward from central portion  3 , and are considered to flare outward relative to central portion  4 . Atrial anchor  2  and ventricular anchor  4  can also be considered flanged relative to central portion  3 . The flared configuration of atrial and ventricular anchors  2  and  4  relative to central portion  3  is described in the context of a side view of the expandable anchor, as can be seen in  FIG. 2  (which illustrates leaflets secured to struts). In some embodiments one or more of the flared anchors are orthogonal to a longitudinal axis “LA” (illustrated in  FIG. 2 ) passing through central opening  6 . In some embodiments the flared anchor portions have a smooth curve radially outward. In some flared configuration the two anchors and the central portion define a general “C” or “U” shape in a side view of the expandable anchor. A “C” or “U” configuration is not limited to symmetrical configurations, however, as there can be slight deviation from a true “U” and still be considered to be U-shaped. For example, the expandable anchor could define a “C” configuration, but one of the atrial and ventricular anchors could have a tighter curvature than the other anchor. When the anchor portions are flared and create a “C” shaped configuration, the atrial and ventricular anchors are slightly curved inward towards the central portion at their respective ends. In some embodiments atrial anchor  2  and ventricular anchor  4  are substantially parallel to one another, such as exactly parallel to one another. In some embodiments the configuration of the flared anchors creates a substantially constant radius of curvature (i.e., a semi-circle) so that stress across anchors  2  and  4 , and central portion  4  is balanced, thereby reducing fatigue or wear at any one point along the prosthesis. \\\\n     In some embodiments the expanded anchor  1  (not including the struts) has a length “L” (see  FIG. 2 , measured from the atrial end to the ventricular end, parallel to the longitudinal axis LA) of 6-12 mm, such as 6-11 mm, 6-10 mm, 6-9 mm, 7-11 mm, 8-10 mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, 8 mm, 9 mm, 10 mm, 11 mm, and 12 mm. In some embodiments the length of the expanded prosthesis, including the struts (“LS” as shown in  FIG. 2 ), has a length of 16-20 mm, such as 17-19 mm, 16 mm, 17 mm, 18 mm, 19 mm, and 20 mm with the struts. In some embodiments, the expanded anchor has an expanded diameter (“D” in  FIG. 2 ) of about 35 mm to about 75 mm, such as about 45 mm to about 65 mm. In some of those embodiments the device is configured to be collapsed to a collapsed configuration in which it has a collapsed diameter D of 7 mm to 12 mm (i.e., the prosthesis can be collapsed down to fit within a 21-36 French catheter). In some embodiments the central opening  6  diameter (“DC” in  FIG. 10A ) is between 20 mm and 45 mm, such as between 25 mm and 40 mm, such as between 28 mm and 38 mm. In embodiments in which central opening  6  is not a perfect circle, the central opening diameter refers to the greatest linear dimension between points on the central portion, when viewed in an end view such as  FIG. 10A . \\\\n     Additionally features of exemplary expandable anchor  1  will now be described in the context of an exemplary method of manufacturing the expandable anchor  1 . Other manufacturing processes, whole or partial, can be used as well.  FIGS. 3-6B  illustrate an exemplary method of manufacturing a ventricular anchor  4  and central portion  3  that are integral, or monolithic.  FIG. 3  illustrates integral central portion  4  and ventricular anchor  3  of expandable anchor  1  that have been cut (e.g., laser cut) out of a flat sheet of material. In some embodiments the material is a nitinol sheet, and in some exemplary embodiments the nitinol sheet is 0.3 mm to 0.35 mm thick. In these embodiments the ventricular anchor and central portion are thus 0.3 mm to 0.35 mm thick. \\\\n     In this embodiment central portion  3 , when cut, comprises a plurality of diamond-shaped cells  7  (only one labeled for clarity), as shown in the dotted lines in  FIG. 3 . In this embodiment there are twelve cells  7  in central portion  3 , all of which have a general diamond shape when laid flat, as in the view shown in  FIG. 3 . Central portion  3  can have fewer or more cells, the cells can have configurations other than general diamond shapes, and the cells need not all have the same configuration. In this embodiment each central portion cell  7  has an aperture  26  at one of the bends in the diamond shape near the atrial end of central portion  3 , but in other embodiments not every cell  7  has an aperture  26 . For example, every other cell could have an aperture  26 . In this embodiment apertures  26  are aligned axially (i.e., as shown they are in a “row”), but in other embodiments there are not. For example, if the cells have different configuration some apertures  26  may not be aligned, or in the same “row” with other apertures. Central portion  3  also includes a plurality of apertures  36  formed in material where adjacent cells  7  meet, as shown in  FIG. 3 . In this embodiment apertures  36  are axially aligned, but in other embodiments they need not be aligned. In this embodiment apertures  36  are in the middle of cells  7  measured in an atrial-to-ventricular end direction (up and down in  FIG. 3 ). \\\\n     Expandable anchor  1  also includes ventricular anchor  4 . In this embodiment ventricular anchor  4  includes a plurality of arches  42  that extend from the central portion towards the ventricular end. The configurations of arches  42  are generally triangular-shaped, “pointing” towards the ventricular end, and include two sections of material and a bend in between the two sections of material. As shown, in each arch  42 , the material first extends away from central portion  4 , forms a bend at the ventricular end of the anchor, and then extends back towards central portion  4 . Arches  42  are triangular shaped in this embodiment, and the ventricular ends can be described as tips of the arches, and in this embodiment are rounded. A plurality of spaces  49  (only two are labeled for clarity) between adjacent arches  42 , the configurations and sizes of which are defined by the configuration of adjacent arches  42 , are configured to advantageously allow the sub-valvular structures, such as chords, to slide between adjacent arches  42  when the ventricular anchor is expanded on the ventricular side of the mitral valve annulus. The configuration of arches  42 , and thus the plurality of spaces  49 , can also provide easier collapse of the ventricular anchor  3  radially inwards when the anchor is collapsed (e.g., for delivery). The arch  42  tips at the ventricular end are rounded, or curved (as opposed to abrupt or sharp) to avoid damaging the tissue when implanted. Additionally, the tip of each arch  42  includes optional hooks  44  extending from the tip. The hooks  44  can face in towards the central opening  15  and embed into the annulus tissue, thereby helping to resist the pressure build-up on the ventricular side of the aorta. \\\\n     In some embodiments any of apertures  26 ,  36 , and  46  can be circular. In some embodiments any of the apertures (such as all of them) can be between 0.3 mm and 0.8 mm in diameter, such as 0.4 mm-0.7 mm, 0.5 mm-0.6 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.7 mm, and 0.8 mm in diameter. \\\\n     In the embodiment in  FIG. 3  the same starting material is used to make the central portion  3  and ventricular anchor  4 . In this embodiment ventricular anchor  4  and central portion  4  are cut from a flat sheet of material (e.g., nitinol). In other embodiments the integral central portion  3  and ventricular anchor  4  can be cut from a tubular starting material. After ventricular anchor  4  and central portion  3  are cut as shown in  FIG. 2 , a next step in manufacturing the expandable anchor is that it is then rolled into a generally cylindrical configuration and the ends of the material are secured together, as shown in the generally cylindrical configuration in the perspective view of  FIG. 4 . In this embodiment apertures  36   a  and  36   b , and  46   a  and  46   b , ( FIG. 3 ) are secured together once the apparatus is reconfigured into the cylindrical configuration in  FIG. 4 . An exemplary method of securing the ends is by riveting the ends at the apertures, wherein a rivet is placed within aligned apertures  36   a  and  36   b , and then the free rivet end is deformed to secure the ends of the apparatus and maintain the cylindrical configuration shown in  FIG. 4 . \\\\n     Alternatively, in some embodiments, integral central portion  3  and ventricular anchor  4  can be cut from a tubular element to form the configuration in  FIG. 4 . In these embodiments ends of the device need not be coupled together since the apparatus has the configuration in  FIG. 3  when cut from the tubular element. \\\\n     Once the apparatus is in the cylindrical configuration shown in  FIG. 4  (whether cut from a flat sheet and rolled, or cut from a tubular element, or from another process), an exemplary subsequent step is to reshape the partial anchor into a shape memory configuration.  FIGS. 5A-6B  illustrate an exemplary shaping process and resulting reconfigured apparatus. As shown in  FIGS. 5A and 5B , the generally cylindrical shaped device is placed in a heat shaping fixture  99 . Once in the heat shaping fixture, the column can be heated, such as in a salt bath at 915 degrees for 3 minutes, and then quenched in water in order to set the shape of the ventricular anchor and central portion. The shape memory configuration of the integral central portion  3  and ventricular anchor  4  are shown in the perspective views in  FIGS. 6A and 6B .  FIG. 6A  shows a perspective view looking from the central portion to the ventricular anchor, and  FIG. 6B  shows a view looking from the ventricular anchor to the central portion. The reference numbers in  FIGS. 6A and 6B  are described herein. A side view of the configuration of the anchor from  FIGS. 6A and 6B  can also be seen in the replacement valve in  FIG. 2 , but the atrial anchor and leaflets have not been added yet to the partial device shown in  FIGS. 6A and 6B . \\\\n     In this exemplary embodiment, once the integral ventricular anchor  4  and central portion  3  are shape set (as shown in  FIGS. 6A and 6B ), atrial anchor  2  is secured to central portion  3 . In this embodiment atrial anchor  2  comprises first frame  122  and second frame  222 , which are shown in  FIGS. 7A and 7B , respectively. In this embodiment frame  122  and  222  have the same configuration and are interchangeable. In this embodiment second frame  222  is an inner frame, and first frame  122  is an outer frame in that first frame  122  is disposed radially outward relative to inner frame  222 . Inner frame  222  also sits proximal to outer frame  122 , although in this embodiment the two atrial frames have the same configuration and thus their designation of inner and outer can be switched. \\\\n     As shown in  FIGS. 7A and 7B , atrial frame  122  includes a plurality of arches  111   a - 111   f  (also referred to herein as arcs, arcuate portions, curved portions, or petals), and atrial frame  222  includes a plurality of arches  211 . In this embodiment each arch  111  includes a peak  113 , and adjacent arches meet at valleys  115  (only one peak and two valleys labeled for clarity). A peak is generally considered the location where the radial distance from the valley is greatest. In this embodiment there are six peaks and six valleys in each of frames  122  and  222 . In this embodiment each frame includes apertures disposed at each of the frame valleys. Frame  122  includes six apertures  116  (one labeled), in this embodiment one at each valley  115 . Frame  222  includes six apertures  226 , one at each valley. In other embodiments a frame may include more or fewer arches, such as between two and fifteen arches. \\\\n     Atrial frame  222  includes arches  211   a - 211   f , each comprising a peak, and valleys one either side of a peak. The arches  211  meet at the valleys, each of which has an aperture  226  therethrough. In this embodiment all of the arches, on both of frames  122  and  222 , comprise a protuberance or extension  118  (only one protuberance labeled, which is on frame  122  in  FIG. 7A ) near the center, or midline, of each arch. The midline is the middle of the length of the arch, as measured linearly between valleys on either side of the arch. The protuberance is a portion of the arch that has increased curvature relative to adjacent portions of the arch. During collapse of the prosthesis, the protuberances  118  can be pulled upon, providing easier collapse and reducing strain in the arches when the anchor is collapsed (e.g., for delivery). \\\\n     In some embodiments either or both of atrial frames  122  and  222  are cut out of a flat sheet, such as a sheet of nitinol, as in the case in  FIGS. 7A and 7B . In some embodiments the sheet of nitinol is 0.2 to 0.25 mm thick, which results in frames that are 0.2 mm to 0.25 mm thick. In this embodiment all of the arches on each frame are integral, or made from the same starting material. Frames  122  and  222  have an annular configuration, as can be seen in  FIGS. 7A and 7B , even though they are not perfectly annular. Annular in this context refers to structures (e.g., atrial frames) that, once assembled as part of the expandable anchor, subtend 360 degrees around a longitudinal axis LA of the expandable frame. In other words, they are generally annular even though they are not perfectly annular. A longitudinal axis as used herein does not impart symmetry to the replacement heart valve, but generally refers to an axis that passes through a central portion of the central opening in the expandable anchor. \\\\n     In the manufacturing of the expandable anchor, atrial frames  122  and  222 , once formed (e.g., cut), are secured to central portion  3 . In this embodiment there are twelve apertures  26  at one end of central portion  3 , as can be seen clearly in  FIG. 3 . Each of frames  122  and  222  has six apertures  116  and  226 , respectively, and in this embodiment each one disposed in a valley of the frame between arches. To secure atrial frame  222  to central portion  3 , each aperture  226  is aligned with an aperture  26  in central portion, the relative positions of which can be seen in  FIG. 8 .  FIG. 8  shows frame  222  assembled to central portion  3  at a plurality of aligned apertures. In this embodiment frame  222  and central portion  3  are configured, including the location of the apertures, such that apertures  226  on frame  222  are aligned with alternating apertures  26  in central portion  3 , as shown in  FIG. 8 . In this embodiment frame  222  and central portion  3  are secured together at the location of the aligned apertures by riveting the components together at the locations of the apertures. A rivet is placed through two aligned apertures, and then one side of the rivet is plastically deformed to secure the atrial frame to the central portion at the location of the aligned apertures. \\\\n     After frame  222  is secured to central portion  3  (which can be seen in  FIG. 8 ), frame  122  is secured to central portion  3  in the same manner, except in this embodiment the six apertures  116  in frame  122  are first aligned with the six apertures  26  that are not yet riveted to frame  222  (the six “open” apertures  26  can be seen in  FIG. 8 ).  FIG. 9  shows the expandable anchor after frame  122  is secured to central portion  3 , which in this embodiment is also done with rivets like frame  222 . Frames  122  and  222  are rotationally offset with one another with respect to central portion (which can be seen in  FIG. 9 ), and in this embodiment the peaks of one frame are rotationally aligned with a valley of the other frame. Frames  122  and  222  overlap at frame sections between the valleys and peaks, and are in contact with one another where they overlap (but in other embodiments the memory configuration may be such that frame are slightly apart such that they do not contact one another where they overlap), which can be seen in  FIG. 9 . In this embodiment the frames overlap between the peaks and valleys. In this configuration arches  111  and  211  of the two frames are considered to be out of phase relative to one another, as can be seen in  FIG. 9 . For example, arches  111  can be approximately 30 degrees out of phase relative to arches  211 . That is, arches  111  of the first frame  122  can overlap with arches  211  of the second frame  222  such that, for example, a single arch  111  of the first outer frame  122  overlaps with half of two underlying arches  211  of the second outer frame  222 . In some embodiments, only some arches are out of phase with one another while other arches are in-phase with one another. When frames  122  and  222  are secured to central portion  3 , the combination of overlapping frames  122  and  222  can form a substantially circular, or annular, outer perimeter (in an end view of the device such as in  FIG. 9 ), which can provide a smooth surface to sit against the atrial tissue. \\\\n     Frames  122  and  222  are secured to central portion  3 , but they are not directly attached to one another. This configuration allows for relative movement between frames  122  and  222 . The relative movement around atrial anchor  2  may allow for atrial anchor  2  to conform better to the tissue on the atrial side of the annulus (there may be patient to patient variability) and help seal the expandable anchor in place better on the atrial side. For example, an arch  111  can be movable relative to the two arches  211  that it overlaps. That is, the outer perimeter of an arch  111  can flex in the direction of the longitudinal axis (axially) and/or translate relative to the two arches  211  that it overlaps, while the radially inner portions of the frames are secured to the central portion of the expandable anchor. The outer perimeter of the atrial anchor essentially creates a substantially circular, or annular, flexible seal whose arches can flex as needed relative to overlapping arches to better conform to the patient&#39;s anatomy and help create a better seal against atrial tissue. \\\\n     After atrial anchor  2  is attached to central portion  3  (shown in  FIG. 9 ), the expandable anchor can be heat shaped again.  FIG. 10  shows the expandable anchor (ventricular anchor  4  arches  42  can be seen in  FIG. 10 ) after it is placed into a shaping fixture  303  and heated, such as at 915 degrees for 3 minutes, and then quenched in water to form the expandable anchor. The configuration of the expandable anchor after this shape setting step is shown in  FIGS. 11A and 11B , with reference numbers described above. \\\\n     The exemplary expandable anchor shown in  FIGS. 11A and 11B , which is shown in an expanded memory configuration, has a ventricular anchor and an atrial anchor that are flared radially outward relative to the central portion such that the self-expandable anchor is configured to secure the replacement mitral valve to a mitral valve orifice in the self-expanded configuration. In this embodiment ventricular anchor  4 , which includes plurality of arches  42 , has a greater stiffness in the axial direction than the atrial anchor when the expandable anchor is in the expanded configuration.  FIG. 2  illustrates hypothetical axially forces “F” applied to the ventricular and atrial anchors, upon which ventricular anchor  4  has a greater resistance to deformation than atrial anchor  2 . The stiffness comparison is generally considered in response to a hypothetical applied force on the radially outer portions of the ventricular and atrial anchors, as shown by forces F in  FIG. 2 . \\\\n     One aspect of the embodiment in  FIGS. 1-11B  that contributes to the ventricular anchor being stiffer than the atrial anchor in an axially direction is that, in this embodiment, the arches in the ventricular anchor have a thickness that is greater than the thickness of each of atrial frames  122  and  222 , and thus the thickness of the arches in the two atrial frames. In this embodiment, however, the thickness of the atrial anchor at the location where the frames overlap is thicker than the thickness of the ventricular arches due to the double layer of material at the overlapping locations. In some merely exemplary embodiments the ventricular arches are 0.3 mm to 0.35 mm thick, which can be provided by cutting the ventricular anchor portion from a sheet of material that is 0.3 mm to 0.35 mm thick. In some embodiments the atrial anchor frames, and thus the arches, are 0.2 mm to 0.25 mm thick. \\\\n     An additional aspect of the embodiment in  FIGS. 1-11B  that contributes to the ventricular anchor being stiffer than the atrial anchor is that the ventricular anchor is formed integrally with the central portion, whereas the atrial anchor portion is made from different starting material and then attached to the central portion. While this embodiment includes two different frames in the atrial anchor portion, in some embodiments the atrial anchor includes only one of the frames. For example, in some alternate embodiments, there is only one atrial frame, which comprises a plurality of peaks and valleys. In these alternative embodiments, while there are not any overlapping arches and thus no relative movement between overlapping arches, the ventricular anchor is still stiffer than the atrial anchor, in part due to the points of attachment between the central portion and the atrial anchor, and because the ventricular anchor has thicker arches than the arches of the atrial anchor. \\\\n     In some alternative embodiments the ventricular anchor arches have the same thickness as the atrial arches, but the integral formation of the ventricular arches with the central portion can provide for the increased stiffness relative to the atrial arches. Additionally, even in designs where there is only one atrial anchor frame, the ventricular arches can have the same thickness as the atrial arches, and the greater stiffness of the ventricular arches is due at least partially to the integral formation of the ventricular anchor and the central portion. \\\\n     In alternative embodiments, the ventricular anchor, central portion, and atrial anchor (regardless of the number of atrial frames) are all integral, but the ventricular arches are thicker than the atrial arches. In one exemplary method of manufacturing, the entire anchor could be integral and cut from a tube, but the central and atrial portions could be ground down to have a smaller thickness than the ventricular portion. Thus even though the three portions of the expandable anchor are all integral, the ventricular side is still stiffer in the axial direction due at least partially due to the thicker ventricular arches. \\\\n     In some embodiments the ventricular portion, central portion, and atrial portion all have different thicknesses. For example, each of the three portions could be made from different starting materials (i.e., non-integral) with different thicknesses, and then secured together. Alternatively, the three portions could be integral and cut from a tube, and then one or more portion could be ground down to achieve a desired thickness in each portion, wherein the end result is that the three sections can have any desired thickness, such as three different thicknesses. \\\\n     Some of the increased flexibility (less stiff) of the atrial arches is also due to the length of the atrial arches (the linear distance between valleys of the atrial arches) compared to the lengths of the ventricular arches (the linear distances between valleys of the ventricular arches). Ventricular valley linear distance “VV” is shown in  FIG. 3 , and atrial valley linear distance “AV” can be seen in  FIG. 7A . In the embodiments shown herein the ventricular valley distance is less than the atrial valley distance (for both of the atrial frames in this embodiment). \\\\n     In some embodiments the height of the ventricular arches “VH” (shown in  FIG. 3 ), before the outward flare is imparted to the arches, is greater than VV. In some embodiments the two distances are substantially the same. \\\\n     The embodiment in  FIGS. 1-11B  is also an example of a self-expandable anchor comprising a ventricular anchor integral with a central portion, and an atrial anchor secured to the central portion but not integral with the central portion. In this embodiment the expandable anchor (excluding the struts), when in an expanded configuration (which can be self-expandable) has a length L, which can be seen in  FIG. 2 . Midline, or half the length, is indicated as “M” in  FIG. 2 . In this embodiment the atrial anchor is disposed solely on the atrial side of the midline. That is, the atrial anchor portion is secured to the central portion on an atrial side of the expandable anchor. In this embodiment central portion  3  defines the radially innermost portion of the expandable anchor (excluding the struts and related structure). \\\\n     In alternative embodiments the ventricular anchor can similarly be non-integral with the central portion and then secured thereto. For example, the ventricular anchor can comprise a ventricular annular frame (similar to an annular atrial frame) that is secured to the central portion, such as with rivets as described with respect to some atrial annular frames herein. \\\\n     In embodiments in which the atrial anchor is not integral with the rest of the anchor, and it secured to the rest of the anchor during manufacturing, the coupling between the atrial anchor and the rest of the expandable anchor can be movable or non-movable couplings. In some situations it may be desirable to have some degree of movement between the atrial anchor and the central portion at the location of the coupling(s). In some scenarios it may be desirable to limit as much motion as possible at the location of the couplings. For example, when rivets are used to secure the atrial anchor to the central portion, examples of which are provided herein, the riveting process can be tailored to accommodate the desired degree of movement between the riveted components. Too much movement between components due to the coupling could, however, lead to material fatigue and failure. Movable coupling as used herein can be thought of as hinge points between two components, or hinge locations. The hinge allows for some movement between the two components, which can enhance, for example, the atrial anchor conforming to atrial tissue. In addition, an expandable anchor that is constructed from more than one component coupled at rivets or hinges may flex freely at the couplings and reduce ultimate material strains. \\\\n     Any of the central portion, the ventricular and atrial anchor portions, and the struts can be formed from different starting materials from one another (i.e., non-integral). Non-integral components can, if desired, allow the various components to be of different flexibilities and stiffnesses, and it can also provide for radial overlapping (relative to the longitudinal axis of central opening) of the components. For example, described above, the atrial anchor can be configured to be more flexible (less stiff) than the ventricular anchor to provide better conformability and sealing in the atrium, while the stiffer ventricular anchor can provide sufficient resistance to pressure in the ventricle. In some embodiments, a thicker material can be used to form the central portion and the ventricular anchor while a thinner material can be used to form the atrial anchor. For example, the ventricular anchor can have a thickness of 0.25 mm to 0.35 mm while the atrial anchor can have a thickness of 0.15 mm to 0.25 mm. Further, in some embodiments, the length of the arches of the ventricular anchor (also referred to herein as the linear distance between valleys) can be shorter than the lengths of the arches of the atrial anchor to increase the stiffness of the ventricular anchor relative to the proximal anchor. For example, in some embodiments the arches of the atrial anchor are between 25 mm and 35 mm, such as approximately 30 mm long, while the length of the arches of the ventricular anchor are between 15 and 25 mm long, such as approximately 20 mm long. \\\\n     Rivets as used herein are an example of a coupler, as that term or derivatives thereof is used herein. The locations where components are secured to one another may be referred to as a coupling herein. Coupling also refers to the two components that are secured together. Riveting as used herein is an example of a method that plastically deforms a coupler to secure two or more components together at a coupling. \\\\n       FIGS. 12 and 13  show exemplary rivets that can be used to secure two or more components together herein (including the struts described below). Rivet  130   a  as shown in  FIG. 12  is a stepped rivet and rivet  130   b  as shown in  FIG. 13  is a straight rivet. The rivets can be inserted through the apertures described herein and the second ends  135  and  137 , respectively, can then be plastically deformed using known riveting techniques to secure the two or more components together. The rivets can be made of a suitable implantable material, such as platinum, platinum-iridium alloy, tantalum, nickel-titanium alloy, or titanium and titanium alloys, such as titanium 6-4eli. In some embodiments, the riveted coupling can be such that one or more rivets are not tightened all the way down to the secured components, which allows for hinging of the coupling, if desired. Rivets used for hinging may be made of materials suitable for implantable bearing surfaces such as Nitronic 60 alloy, or nitinol. Hinge pins can be coated with low-friction, high-durability coatings, such as diamond-like coating, or titanium nitride. Referring to  FIG. 13 , a stepped rivet can be used as a hinge pin. The stepped rivet can include a step, or change of diameter section  131 , such that one attached component can ride along a portion of the step. In some embodiments, hinge pins can be used to attach the atrial anchor, thereby providing more flexibility for the atrial anchor. Riveting and hinging can advantageously provide for better collapsing for delivery, including a smaller delivery profile, the advantages of which are described herein, such as for transseptal access to the mitral valve. Exemplary dimensions of rivets are shown in  FIGS. 12 and 13 , in millimeters. \\\\n     Use of rivets and hinges (as opposed to, for example, crimp tubes) can provide an additional benefit of preventing cracking that can occur as single pieces of material flex and move. Additionally, rivets and hinges can provide various degrees of relevant movement between portions of the valve, which can allow the valve to be collapsed into a smaller delivery profile for delivery. The relative movement can also provide increased flexibility of the valve during delivery. Rivets can also allow for a variation in the relative orientation of the riveted components. In some embodiments, rivets provide increased flexibility that allows for greater trackability during delivery and better self-centering of the anchor against cardiac tissue (i.e., provides advantages for both access and conformability to the anatomy). \\\\n     The couplings herein (e.g., riveting) also allow different section of material with different physical properties to be secured to one another. This allows different sections of the expandable anchor to have different properties (e.g., stiffness) than other sections, as may be needed based on, for example, anatomical requirements. For example, atrial anchors can be made thinner than the central portion and/or ventricular anchors. \\\\n     The prostheses herein also include a plurality of struts, to which are attached replacement leaflets, which are configured to control blood flow therethrough.  FIGS. 1 and 15  are perspective views illustrating three struts  5  that are individually secured to central portion  3  of the expandable anchor, and are extending distally (towards the ventricular anchor).  FIG. 1  is a view from the atrial side to the ventricular side, while  FIG. 12  is a view from the ventricular side to the atrial side.  FIG. 14  illustrates one of the three struts  5  in the embodiment in  FIGS. 1 and 12 . In this exemplary embodiment three individual struts  5  are secured to central portion  3  at riveted couplings, in the same general manner as how the atrial anchor can be secured to the central portion, as described herein. Struts  5  have a ventricular end  59  and an atrial end  61 , as shown in  FIG. 14 . Atrial end  61  includes a plurality of apertures  57   a ,  57   b , and  57   c , which are configured to be secured to apertures  36  in the central portion, such as using rivets or hinge pins as described herein. Struts  5  includes three elongate portions  55   a ,  55   b , and  55   c , each extending from ventricular end  59  and each of which has a free end at the atrial end  61 . The free ends include the apertures  57   a - c . Elongate portion  55   b  has a straight configuration, while elongate portions  55   a  and  55   c  are curved and flared outward relative to elongate portion  55   b . Struts  5  have a generally triangular configuration, pointing in the distal direction. The triangular struts  5  can provide vertical strength and lateral flexibility. Elongate portions  55   a  and  55   c  are curved and have a longer overall length than the middle straight elongate portion  55   b  so as to provide an arched shape that lowers stress along the leaflets. Further, the atrial ends  61  of each outer elongate portion  55   a  and  55   c  can include a spring  51   a  and  51   c , respectively, such as a clock spring, that is configured to compensate for the difference in lengths of elongate portions  55   a ,  55   b , and  55   c  when the prosthesis  1  is collapsed inwards into a collapsed configuration. The curved elongate portions  55   a  and  55   c  further include suture holes  53  and/or striations or bumps  56  along the outer perimeter to provide suture attachment points for the leaflets. The struts herein can be, for example, cut from flat metal sheet or tubing. \\\\n       FIG. 15  shows three struts  5  from  FIG. 11  coupled to central portion  3 .  FIG. 15  shows the subassembly from  FIG. 1 , but the view in  FIG. 15  is from the ventricular side looking towards the atrial side. \\\\n     As shown in  FIG. 15 , struts  5  are attached to central portion  3  with the struts extending distally. In some embodiments there can be three struts  5  located approximately 120 degrees away from one another around the circumference of the central portion. In other embodiments, the three strut legs may be located 90 degrees apart from each other with 30 degree gaps between the legs of adjacent three strut legs. \\\\n     Referring to  FIGS. 16 and 2 , in some embodiments, the valve prosthesis  1  can include valve leaflets  20   a ,  20   b , and  20   c  attached, such as sewn, to struts  5 . There can be three integral valve leaflets  20   a ,  20   b , and  20   c , and the leaflets can form a pressure actuated valve that provides uni-directional flow occlusion when the prosthesis  1  is implanted in a valve orifice. The leaflets  20   a - c  can be constructed of bio-materials, such as bovine or porcine pericardium, or polymer materials. \\\\n       FIG. 17  illustrates central portion  4  comprising optional skirt  120  thereon or therearound formed of a biomaterial or thin polymer material.  FIG. 17  is a perspective view of an exemplary prosthesis  1  with leaflets  20   a - c , and skirt  120 . The skirt can advantageously help seal prosthesis  1  against the cardiac tissue when implanted. In some embodiments, the ventricular anchor can include a skirt in place of, or in addition to, the skirt  120  on central portion  3 . Additionally, a skirt can optionally be on the atrial anchor portion as well. \\\\n       FIG. 18  illustrates an exemplary strut  70 . As shown in the embodiment of strut  70  in  FIG. 18 , a pin and slot mechanism (i.e., having an axially extending slot  83  along the middle elongate component  75   b ), could be used to make up for the differences in the lengths of elongate portions  75   a - c  during collapse. \\\\n     Some central portions herein or other portions of other replacement heart valves may be susceptible to undesirable deforming when implanted, such as due to movement during the heartbeat and/or in response to pressures in the heart. In some embodiments the expandable anchor includes an annular strut frame coupled to a radially inner portion of the central portion (i.e., within the central portion). An annular strut frame may distribute forces more evenly over the central portion of the expandable anchor and may reduce the likelihood of undesirable central portion deformation once implanted. \\\\n     An annular strut frame, if used, is an additional layer of material secured to the radially inner portion of the central portion, which reinforces and stabilizes the central portion when implanted. Additionally, by creating a coupling between the struts and the central portion (as opposed to having a solid portion of material that can provide additional stability), the flexibility of the coupling allows for relative movement of the struts during collapse of the device. This can reduce stresses on the device as it is collapsed, allowing for a smaller delivery profile, which as discussed herein can be important for delivery, such as a transseptal approach. The term annular in this context does not require a perfect annulus. \\\\n     When the prosthesis includes a strut frame, the struts can either be integral to the strut frame or they can be separate components that are secured to the strut frame during manufacturing. \\\\n       FIG. 19  is a perspective view illustrating an exemplary annular strut frame  1000 . Strut frame  1000  includes frame portion  1002  and plurality of struts  1004 . Struts  1004  extend further distally (i.e., in the ventricular direction) than frame portion  1002 , and are configured to be secured to replacement leaflets as described herein. The strut frame  1000  has a ventricular end  1006  and an atrial end  1008 . Strut portion  1002  includes a plurality of arches, which define peaks  1012  and valleys  1014 . In this embodiment there are six strut frame arches, with two between adjacent struts  1004 . Struts  1004  have an arch configuration defined by first leg  1020  and second leg  1022 , each of which has a plurality of suture apertures  1018  therein. Struts  1004  each also have first and second extensions  1024  and  1026  extending away from legs  1020  and  1022  and towards atrial end  1008 . Extensions  1024  and  1026  may also be considered part of the frame portion rather than the struts. Replacement leaflets are secured to struts  1004  at holes  1018  (e.g., by suturing). The strut frame also includes a plurality of apertures  1010  near the atrial end  1008 , which are used to secure the annular strut frame to the central portion of the expandable anchor. The apertures are located at valleys  1014  in the frame portion. In some embodiments the annular strut frame is positioned radially within the central portion so that each of apertures  1010  is aligned with an aperture in the central portion, such as apertures  36 . A coupler (e.g., rivet) is then advanced through the aligned apertures and one side of the coupler is then plastically deformed to secure the annular strut frame to the central portion. \\\\n       FIG. 20  illustrates an exemplary annular strut frame  1100 . Strut frame  1100  includes three struts  1104  and frame portion  1102 , which in this embodiment includes one arch between adjacent struts  1104 . Unlike the embodiment in  FIG. 19 , in which there is one coupling aperture  1010  within each strut, in this embodiment there are two apertures  1110  within each strut  1104 . Just as in the embodiment in  FIG. 19 , there are also apertures at the ends of each leg of struts. Strut frame  1100  is coupled to a central portion by aligning apertures  1110  with apertures in the central portion, such as aperture  36 , and then extending a coupler through each set of aligned apertures, and plastically deforming each coupler to secure the central portion to the annular strut frame at the locations of the couplings. \\\\n       FIGS. 19 and 20  illustrate exemplary strut frames in their expanded configurations, when the rest of the expandable anchor (e.g., ventricular anchor, central portion, and atrial anchor) is also in an expanded configuration. Strut frames  19  and  20  can be secured to, and considered part of, any of the expandable anchors herein. \\\\n     In an exemplary method of manufacturing, the strut frame is cut from a tubular element, then expanded, and set in the expanded configuration using shape setting techniques described herein or otherwise known. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, the frame is cut from a 10 mm diameter tube, then expanded to an expanded configuration of about 32 mm (as shown in  FIG. 19 ), and set in the expanded configuration. In some exemplary embodiments the strut frames herein are 0.25 mm to about 0.45 mm thick, such as about 0.35 mm thick. \\\\n     The annular strut frame can be cut from a flat sheet and rolled up and secured together (examples of which are described above), or it can be cut from a tubular structure. \\\\n       FIGS. 19 and 20  illustrate exemplary annular, or cylindrical, strut frames that are disposed radially within the central portion of the expandable anchor. The central portion and the strut frame can be thought of as creating a composite cylinder when they are coupled together. The composite cylinder is thicker than each of the central portion and strut frame individually. Each of the central portion and strut frame is, however, relatively thin and can flex with respect to the other component. The relative flexibility can make it easier to collapse into a delivery configuration. If the composite region were a single material with a thickness equivalent to the combined thickness of the central portion and strut frame, that modified region may not be able to collapse sufficiently to meet, for example, size constraints without overstraining. The central portion and strut frame acting as a composite structure will not overstrain when collapsed into a collapsed configuration since the central portion and strut frame can flex independently. The composite central portion and strut frame also, when the expandable anchor expands, has a thickness greater than each component individually, thus providing an increased thickness that may be needed to resist torquing and other forces on the central portion when implanted. The composite central portion and cylindrical strut frame thus enables collapsing as needed without overstraining, as well as provides a thickness to the central region that resists torquing and deformation due to forces acting on the expandable anchor when implanted. \\\\n     In some embodiments various components of the prosthesis are described as being formed out of a flat sheet of material, but in some embodiments they can be formed out of a tubular element or other shape of material. \\\\n     In some embodiments the configuration of the arches on the ventricular anchor portion might be the same as configuration shown herein (such as in  FIG. 2 ), but the ventricular anchor portion could be a separate frame that is secured to the central portion, just as some atrial anchors are secured to the central portion in exemplary embodiments herein. Both anchors can be separate components secured to central portion (not integral with central portion), and in some embodiments both ventricular and atrial anchors can be integral with the central portion. \\\\n     In some embodiments, a prosthesis can include ventricular and atrial anchor portions that are both configured like anchor portion  2  herein. For example, both the ventricular and atrial anchor portions could be frames that are secured to the central portion. In some embodiments, a prosthesis can include ventricular and atrial anchor portions that are both configured like anchor portion  4  herein. \\\\n     The prostheses herein can be configured to self-expand within a cardiac valve orifice such that the central portion lines the valve orifice while the atrial and ventricular anchors sit within the chambers of the heart and pinch tissue of the orifice therebetween, securing the prosthesis in place. Methods of delivery and deployment of prostheses that are fully incorporated herein and can be used to deliver and deploy any of the prostheses herein can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,870,948, issued Oct. 28, 2014. \\\\n     It is conceivable that the prostheses described herein can be used to replace valves other than the mitral valve, such as the aortic valve, the tricuspid valve, and the pulmonary valve. \\\\n       FIG. 21  illustrates an exemplary configuration of a portion of expandable anchor  1  (struts and leaflets not shown for clarity) in a collapsed configuration, in which only one atrial anchor frame has been secured to central portion  3 . The expandable anchor  1  can be configured to be collapsed for delivery through a catheter. In the collapsed configuration (shown in  FIG. 21 ), the atrial and ventricular anchors  2  and  4 , respectively, are extended outwards, and the entire expandable anchor can be radially collapsed. All of the arches become narrower, as do the cells in central portion  3 . The expandable anchor  1  in its collapsed state can maintain a strain of less than 6% at all locations. A device and method for collapse is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/170,388, filed Jan. 31, 2014, and titled “SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CARDIAC VALVE REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT,” now U.S. Pat. No. 8,870,948, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. \\\\n     One aspect of the disclosure is a replacement mitral valve, comprising: a self-expandable anchor comprising a ventricular anchor, a central portion, and an atrial anchor, the atrial anchor portion not being integral with the central portion and secured to the central portion, the self-expandable anchor having a self-expanded configuration in which the ventricular anchor and the atrial anchor are flared radially outward relative to the central portion such that the self-expandable anchor is configured to secure the replacement mitral valve to a mitral valve annulus in the self-expanded configuration, wherein the atrial anchor includes a frame having a plurality of arches and a plurality of apertures therethrough, and wherein the central portion includes a plurality of apertures therethrough, at least some of which are in alignment with one of the plurality of frame apertures; securing the frame to the central portion by extending a coupler through a central portion aperture and a frame aperture, and plastically deforming the coupler on one side of the aligned apertures, wherein plastically deforming the coupler secures the central portion and the frame at the location of the coupler; and a plurality of replacement leaflets secured to the expandable anchor. \\\\n     Any of the individual components of any prostheses herein can be interchanged with components in any other example, and the examples described herein are not limited to the specific components in those examples.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]\""

Various diseases can affect the function of the mitral valve, including degenerative mitral valve disease and mitral valve prolapse. These diseases can cause mitral stenosis, in which the valve fails to open fully and thereby obstructs blood flow, and/or mitral insufficiency, in which the mitral valve is incompetent and blood flows passively in the wrong direction.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Many patients with heart disease, such as problems with the mitral valve, are intolerant of the trauma associated with open-heart surgery. Age or advanced illness may have impaired the patient&#39;s ability to recover from the injury of an open-heart procedure. Additionally, the high costs are associated with open-heart surgery and extra-corporeal perfusion can make such procedures prohibitive.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Patients in need of cardiac valve repair or cardiac valve replacement can be served by minimally invasive surgical techniques. In many minimally invasive procedures, small devices are manipulated within the patient&#39;s body under visualization from a live imaging source like ultrasound, fluoroscopy, or endoscopy. Minimally invasive cardiac procedures are inherently less traumatic than open procedures and may be performed without extra-corporeal perfusion, which carries a significant risk of procedural complications.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement devices, such as the Medtronic Corevalve or the Edwards Sapien, deliver aortic valve prostheses through small tubes which may be positioned within the heart through the aorta via the femoral artery or through the apex of the heart. However, current cardiac valve prostheses are not designed to function effectively within the mitral valve. Further, current cardiac valve prostheses delivered via a minimally invasive device are often difficult to place correctly within the native valve, difficult to match in size to the native valve, and difficult to retrieve and replace if initially placed incorrectly. Furthermore, the mitral valve differs from the aortic valve in that the shape and anatomy immediately surrounding the valve varies greatly from one side of the valve to the other. One access route for delivering replacement mitral valves requires a transseptal approach. Delivering a replacement valve transseptally imparts limitations on the size of the delivery device and the delivery profile of the replacement valve within the delivery device, and imparts certain flexibility requirements for the replacement valve itself as it is delivered transseptally to the location of the native mitral valve. In some embodiments a sheath passing through a septum should be at most about 24F-28F.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">Many current minimally invasive valve devices are made from super-elastic Nickel-Titanium alloys. These super-elastic alloys allow high material strains, usually 6%-8%, without permanent deformation. Therefore, the alloys allow the valve devices to be packed into a small 6-10 mm diameter tube for delivery while expanding to around 50 mm within the heart. Current manufacturing methods typically involve cutting the valve prosthesis, at least the expandable anchor portion thereof, from a single tubular element that has a uniform thickness along its length. In these cases, the cut expandable anchor may have the same thickness along its length, and thus may not have varying stiffness along the length of the device. The inability to create an expandable anchor with varying thickness throughout can limit the functionality of different regions of the expandable anchor. Certain regions of the expandable anchor may be limited in what they can be configured to perform by creating the valve from a single tubular element. This can be undesirable if there is a need to create certain functionality in different regions of the expandable anchor that result from the regions have different thicknesses. Similarly, traditional expandable anchors made from a single tubular element do not have overlapping components (radially), wherein overlapping components may help impart additional flexibility to portions of the expandable anchor, and/or allow the expandable anchor to be collapsed to have a smaller delivery profile. Furthermore, in a single-piece construction, strains are limited to the elastic strain limit of the material, which may be too low for some applications.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">These and other deficiencies in existing approaches are described herein.</p>\\\\n    <heading id=\"h-0004\">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">One aspect of the disclosure is a replacement mitral valve, comprising: a self-expandable anchor comprising a ventricular anchor, a central portion, and an atrial anchor, the self-expandable anchor having a self-expanded configuration in which the ventricular anchor and the atrial anchor are flared radially outward relative to the central portion such that the replacement mitral valve is configured to be secured within a mitral valve orifice, the ventricular anchor having greater stiffness in an axial direction than the atrial anchor when the expandable anchor is in the self-expanded configuration;

This disclosure describes the prostheses in the context of replacement mitral valves, but it is conceivable that the prostheses herein can be used or modified to be used as other replacement heart valves. In some embodiments the replacement heart valves are self-orienting (at least on one side) replacement mitral valves configured to be delivered using minimally invasive techniques.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">The replacement heart valves herein include an expandable anchor that includes an atrial anchor (e.g., configured to be placed on an atrial side of a mitral valve annulus), a ventricular anchor (e.g., configured to be placed on a ventricular side of a mitral valve annulus), and a central portion axially between the atrial and ventricular anchors. The expandable anchor is adapted to be collapsed towards a collapsed delivery configuration, and is adapted to expand towards an expandable configuration. The replacement heart valves also include a plurality of struts secured to at least one of the central portion, the ventricular anchor, or the atrial anchor, the struts being secured to a plurality of replacement leaflets. The struts can be considered part of the expandable anchor, and in embodiments herein are configured to deform as the rest of the expandable anchor is collapsed. It may be possible to incorporate struts that are not deformable, but which are still secured to the expandable anchor. These types of struts may not be considered part of the expandable anchor but are secured to the expandable anchor. The struts extend distally, that is, towards the ventricular anchor. In the context of replacement mitral valves, the “distal” end of the replacement valve refers to the end of the replacement valve that is to be positioned on the ventricular side of the annulus, while “proximal” end refers to the end of the replacement valve that is to be positioned on the atrial side of the annulus. “Distally” in the context of delivery can be used to refer to a location closer to the left ventricle than the left atrium, while “proximally” is generally used to refer to a location closer to the left atrium than the left ventricle.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">In some embodiment the expandable anchor is adapted to completely self-expand, and in some embodiments it is configured to be partially self-expanding and partially expand by non-self-expanding influences (e.g., a balloon). The expandable anchors can be made of (or partly made of) a super elastic material such as nitinol.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">One of the advantages of some of the replacement heart valves herein, and the methods of manufacturing provided herein, is that different regions of expandable anchors can have different physical characteristics that would not have been possible with alternative designs. For example, in some embodiments the expandable anchor is manufactured from two or more separate components of material that are secured together during manufacturing. By securing two or more different components together to create the expandable anchor, different starting materials can be used for the different components, and thus different materials with different properties can be used for different regions of the expandable anchor. The different properties can be chosen to impart desired physical characteristics to different regions of the expandable anchor.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">When two components are secured together during manufacturing they are considered to be non-integral, or non-monolithic, components. Different portions of the expandable anchor that are made from the same starting material are considered to be integral, or monolithic. For example, a manufacturing step could include cutting a strut and an expandable anchor from different pieces of starting material, and securing them together, and they would be considered non-integral. In some embodiments, when one or more components are secured together, the coupling of the two components can be made so that the two components are rigidly secured at the coupling, or so that the two components can move to some degree at the location of the coupling of the two components (e.g., pivotable).</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">In methods of use, the prostheses described herein can be delivered to a cardiac valve orifice, such as the mitral valve, by using minimally invasive techniques to access the cardiac valve. Access routes and procedures are known, such as making small incisions in the patient&#39;s body and passing the prosthesis through the apex of the heart to, for example, a mitral valve. An additional exemplary access route includes delivering the valve through the venous system and into the left atrium via a transseptal puncture. A transseptal approach can impart size limitations on the delivery and thus the delivery profile of the replacement heart valve. Additionally, a transseptal approach can also impart certain flexibility requirements on the replacement heart valve. The replacement heart valves herein are configured to be collapsed into a delivery configuration so they can fit within a delivery device. The replacement heart valves can be delivered to the treatment site within the delivery device and then deployed from the delivery device. If necessary, the replacement valves can be repositioned, re-sheathed (partially or completely) if necessary, and then re-deployed.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">When the replacement heart valve has been delivered near the mitral valve, the ventricular anchor can be deployed first in a cardiac chamber, such as the ventricle, and retracted to a seated position against the valve orifice, such as the mitral valve orifice. Then the center portion and atrial anchor portion may be deployed in another cardiac chamber, such as the atrium, wherein the expansion and reconfiguration of the atrial anchor and the central portion sandwiches the valve orifice securely between the anchors that have been deployed on either side of the annulus. Other exemplary aspects of the methods of delivery described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,870,948, issued Oct. 28, 2014 can be incorporated into any of the methods of delivery herein.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">Replacement heart valves herein are configured to be secured in the native valve orifice by sandwiching the cardiac orifice between ventricular and atrial anchors, which are larger in diameter than the valve orifice, and by applying a radial force from the center portion outward against the cardiac orifice. Additional engagement between the prostheses and cardiac tissue can be added with wire hooks extending from the valve prostheses.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a portion of an exemplary mitral valve prosthesis in an expanded configuration after an expandable anchor and struts have been secured together. The portion of the replacement valve shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> may be referred to as an anchor subassembly, which excludes leaflets and any skirts that may be incorporated into the final replacement valve. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> shows a view from an atrial side to a ventricular side. Expandable anchor <b>1</b> includes an atrial anchor <b>2</b>, a ventricular anchor <b>4</b>, and a central portion <b>3</b> therebetween. In this embodiment atrial anchor <b>2</b> is configured and adapted to be disposed on an atrial side of a mitral valve orifice, and ventricular anchor <b>4</b> is configured and adapted to be disposed on a ventricle side of the mitral valve orifice. In some uses, however, anchor <b>1</b> may be implanted so that atrial anchor <b>2</b> as shown is positioned on the ventricle side and ventricular anchor <b>4</b> is positioned on the atrial side. Three struts <b>5</b> are secured to the expandable anchor, and in this embodiment are secured to central portion <b>3</b>, and at least a portion of struts <b>5</b> are disposed radially inward relative to central portion <b>3</b>. Struts <b>5</b> are extending, or pointing, towards ventricular anchor <b>4</b> and away from atrial anchor <b>2</b>.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">Radially inner surfaces of the expandable anchor and the struts define central opening <b>6</b>, which is radially within the expandable anchor. The radially inner surfaces of central portion <b>3</b> substantially define the perimeter of central opening <b>6</b>. Replacement leaflets, which are not shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> for clarity, are secured to struts <b>5</b> and are disposed at least partially in central opening <b>6</b>, and are configured to control blood flow therethrough.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">In the expanded configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> (which is also an “as-manufactured” configuration), atrial anchor <b>2</b> and ventricular anchor <b>4</b> extend radially outward from central portion <b>3</b>, and are considered to flare outward relative to central portion <b>4</b>. Atrial anchor <b>2</b> and ventricular anchor <b>4</b> can also be considered flanged relative to central portion <b>3</b>. The flared configuration of atrial and ventricular anchors <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> relative to central portion <b>3</b> is described in the context of a side view of the expandable anchor, as can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> (which illustrates leaflets secured to struts). In some embodiments one or more of the flared anchors are orthogonal to a longitudinal axis “LA” (illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>) passing through central opening <b>6</b>. In some embodiments the flared anchor portions have a smooth curve radially outward. In some flared configuration the two anchors and the central portion define a general “C” or “U” shape in a side view of the expandable anchor. A “C” or “U” configuration is not limited to symmetrical configurations, however, as there can be slight deviation from a true “U” and still be considered to be U-shaped. For example, the expandable anchor could define a “C” configuration, but one of the atrial and ventricular anchors could have a tighter curvature than the other anchor. When the anchor portions are flared and create a “C” shaped configuration, the atrial and ventricular anchors are slightly curved inward towards the central portion at their respective ends. In some embodiments atrial anchor <b>2</b> and ventricular anchor <b>4</b> are substantially parallel to one another, such as exactly parallel to one another. In some embodiments the configuration of the flared anchors creates a substantially constant radius of curvature (i.e., a semi-circle) so that stress across anchors <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, and central portion <b>4</b> is balanced, thereby reducing fatigue or wear at any one point along the prosthesis.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">In some embodiments the expanded anchor <b>1</b> (not including the struts) has a length “L” (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, measured from the atrial end to the ventricular end, parallel to the longitudinal axis LA) of 6-12 mm, such as 6-11 mm, 6-10 mm, 6-9 mm, 7-11 mm, 8-10 mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, 8 mm, 9 mm, 10 mm, 11 mm, and 12 mm. In some embodiments the length of the expanded prosthesis, including the struts (“LS” as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>), has a length of 16-20 mm, such as 17-19 mm, 16 mm, 17 mm, 18 mm, 19 mm, and 20 mm with the struts. In some embodiments, the expanded anchor has an expanded diameter (“D” in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>) of about 35 mm to about 75 mm, such as about 45 mm to about 65 mm. In some of those embodiments the device is configured to be collapsed to a collapsed configuration in which it has a collapsed diameter D of 7 mm to 12 mm (i.e., the prosthesis can be collapsed down to fit within a 21-36 French catheter). In some embodiments the central opening <b>6</b> diameter (“DC” in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10A</figref>) is between 20 mm and 45 mm, such as between 25 mm and 40 mm, such as between 28 mm and 38 mm. In embodiments in which central opening <b>6</b> is not a perfect circle, the central opening diameter refers to the greatest linear dimension between points on the central portion, when viewed in an end view such as <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10A</figref>.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">Additionally features of exemplary expandable anchor <b>1</b> will now be described in the context of an exemplary method of manufacturing the expandable anchor <b>1</b>. Other manufacturing processes, whole or partial, can be used as well. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3-6B</figref> illustrate an exemplary method of manufacturing a ventricular anchor <b>4</b> and central portion <b>3</b> that are integral, or monolithic. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates integral central portion <b>4</b> and ventricular anchor <b>3</b> of expandable anchor <b>1</b> that have been cut (e.g., laser cut) out of a flat sheet of material. In some embodiments the material is a nitinol sheet, and in some exemplary embodiments the nitinol sheet is 0.3 mm to 0.35 mm thick. In these embodiments the ventricular anchor and central portion are thus 0.3 mm to 0.35 mm thick.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">In this embodiment central portion <b>3</b>, when cut, comprises a plurality of diamond-shaped cells <b>7</b> (only one labeled for clarity), as shown in the dotted lines in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>. In this embodiment there are twelve cells <b>7</b> in central portion <b>3</b>, all of which have a general diamond shape when laid flat, as in the view shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>. Central portion <b>3</b> can have fewer or more cells, the cells can have configurations other than general diamond shapes, and the cells need not all have the same configuration. In this embodiment each central portion cell <b>7</b> has an aperture <b>26</b> at one of the bends in the diamond shape near the atrial end of central portion <b>3</b>, but in other embodiments not every cell <b>7</b> has an aperture <b>26</b>. For example, every other cell could have an aperture <b>26</b>. In this embodiment apertures <b>26</b> are aligned axially (i.e., as shown they are in a “row”), but in other embodiments there are not. For example, if the cells have different configuration some apertures <b>26</b> may not be aligned, or in the same “row” with other apertures. Central portion <b>3</b> also includes a plurality of apertures <b>36</b> formed in material where adjacent cells <b>7</b> meet, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>. In this embodiment apertures <b>36</b> are axially aligned, but in other embodiments they need not be aligned. In this embodiment apertures <b>36</b> are in the middle of cells <b>7</b> measured in an atrial-to-ventricular end direction (up and down in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">Expandable anchor <b>1</b> also includes ventricular anchor <b>4</b>. In this embodiment ventricular anchor <b>4</b> includes a plurality of arches <b>42</b> that extend from the central portion towards the ventricular end. The configurations of arches <b>42</b> are generally triangular-shaped, “pointing” towards the ventricular end, and include two sections of material and a bend in between the two sections of material. As shown, in each arch <b>42</b>, the material first extends away from central portion <b>4</b>, forms a bend at the ventricular end of the anchor, and then extends back towards central portion <b>4</b>. Arches <b>42</b> are triangular shaped in this embodiment, and the ventricular ends can be described as tips of the arches, and in this embodiment are rounded. A plurality of spaces <b>49</b> (only two are labeled for clarity) between adjacent arches <b>42</b>, the configurations and sizes of which are defined by the configuration of adjacent arches <b>42</b>, are configured to advantageously allow the sub-valvular structures, such as chords, to slide between adjacent arches <b>42</b> when the ventricular anchor is expanded on the ventricular side of the mitral valve annulus. The configuration of arches <b>42</b>, and thus the plurality of spaces <b>49</b>, can also provide easier collapse of the ventricular anchor <b>3</b> radially inwards when the anchor is collapsed (e.g., for delivery). The arch <b>42</b> tips at the ventricular end are rounded, or curved (as opposed to abrupt or sharp) to avoid damaging the tissue when implanted. Additionally, the tip of each arch <b>42</b> includes optional hooks <b>44</b> extending from the tip. The hooks <b>44</b> can face in towards the central opening <b>15</b> and embed into the annulus tissue, thereby helping to resist the pressure build-up on the ventricular side of the aorta.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">In some embodiments any of apertures <b>26</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>46</b> can be circular. In some embodiments any of the apertures (such as all of them) can be between 0.3 mm and 0.8 mm in diameter, such as 0.4 mm-0.7 mm, 0.5 mm-0.6 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.7 mm, and 0.8 mm in diameter.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\">In the embodiment in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> the same starting material is used to make the central portion <b>3</b> and ventricular anchor <b>4</b>. In this embodiment ventricular anchor <b>4</b> and central portion <b>4</b> are cut from a flat sheet of material (e.g., nitinol). In other embodiments the integral central portion <b>3</b> and ventricular anchor <b>4</b> can be cut from a tubular starting material. After ventricular anchor <b>4</b> and central portion <b>3</b> are cut as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, a next step in manufacturing the expandable anchor is that it is then rolled into a generally cylindrical configuration and the ends of the material are secured together, as shown in the generally cylindrical configuration in the perspective view of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>. In this embodiment apertures <b>36</b> <i>a </i>and <b>36</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>46</b> <i>a </i>and <b>46</b> <i>b</i>, (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>) are secured together once the apparatus is reconfigured into the cylindrical configuration in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>. An exemplary method of securing the ends is by riveting the ends at the apertures, wherein a rivet is placed within aligned apertures <b>36</b> <i>a </i>and <b>36</b> <i>b</i>, and then the free rivet end is deformed to secure the ends of the apparatus and maintain the cylindrical configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">Alternatively, in some embodiments, integral central portion <b>3</b> and ventricular anchor <b>4</b> can be cut from a tubular element to form the configuration in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>. In these embodiments ends of the device need not be coupled together since the apparatus has the configuration in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> when cut from the tubular element.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">Once the apparatus is in the cylindrical configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> (whether cut from a flat sheet and rolled, or cut from a tubular element, or from another process), an exemplary subsequent step is to reshape the partial anchor into a shape memory configuration. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A-6B</figref> illustrate an exemplary shaping process and resulting reconfigured apparatus. As shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the generally cylindrical shaped device is placed in a heat shaping fixture <b>99</b>. Once in the heat shaping fixture, the column can be heated, such as in a salt bath at 915 degrees for 3 minutes, and then quenched in water in order to set the shape of the ventricular anchor and central portion. The shape memory configuration of the integral central portion <b>3</b> and ventricular anchor <b>4</b> are shown in the perspective views in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6A</figref> shows a perspective view looking from the central portion to the ventricular anchor, and <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6B</figref> shows a view looking from the ventricular anchor to the central portion. The reference numbers in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are described herein. A side view of the configuration of the anchor from <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> can also be seen in the replacement valve in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, but the atrial anchor and leaflets have not been added yet to the partial device shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">In this exemplary embodiment, once the integral ventricular anchor <b>4</b> and central portion <b>3</b> are shape set (as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>), atrial anchor <b>2</b> is secured to central portion <b>3</b>. In this embodiment atrial anchor <b>2</b> comprises first frame <b>122</b> and second frame <b>222</b>, which are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, respectively. In this embodiment frame <b>122</b> and <b>222</b> have the same configuration and are interchangeable. In this embodiment second frame <b>222</b> is an inner frame, and first frame <b>122</b> is an outer frame in that first frame <b>122</b> is disposed radially outward relative to inner frame <b>222</b>. Inner frame <b>222</b> also sits proximal to outer frame <b>122</b>, although in this embodiment the two atrial frames have the same configuration and thus their designation of inner and outer can be switched.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">As shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, atrial frame <b>122</b> includes a plurality of arches <b>111</b> <i>a</i>-<b>111</b> <i>f </i>(also referred to herein as arcs, arcuate portions, curved portions, or petals), and atrial frame <b>222</b> includes a plurality of arches <b>211</b>. In this embodiment each arch <b>111</b> includes a peak <b>113</b>, and adjacent arches meet at valleys <b>115</b> (only one peak and two valleys labeled for clarity). A peak is generally considered the location where the radial distance from the valley is greatest. In this embodiment there are six peaks and six valleys in each of frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b>. In this embodiment each frame includes apertures disposed at each of the frame valleys. Frame <b>122</b> includes six apertures <b>116</b> (one labeled), in this embodiment one at each valley <b>115</b>. Frame <b>222</b> includes six apertures <b>226</b>, one at each valley. In other embodiments a frame may include more or fewer arches, such as between two and fifteen arches.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">Atrial frame <b>222</b> includes arches <b>211</b> <i>a</i>-<b>211</b> <i>f</i>, each comprising a peak, and valleys one either side of a peak. The arches <b>211</b> meet at the valleys, each of which has an aperture <b>226</b> therethrough. In this embodiment all of the arches, on both of frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b>, comprise a protuberance or extension <b>118</b> (only one protuberance labeled, which is on frame <b>122</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7A</figref>) near the center, or midline, of each arch. The midline is the middle of the length of the arch, as measured linearly between valleys on either side of the arch. The protuberance is a portion of the arch that has increased curvature relative to adjacent portions of the arch. During collapse of the prosthesis, the protuberances <b>118</b> can be pulled upon, providing easier collapse and reducing strain in the arches when the anchor is collapsed (e.g., for delivery).</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">In some embodiments either or both of atrial frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b> are cut out of a flat sheet, such as a sheet of nitinol, as in the case in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. In some embodiments the sheet of nitinol is 0.2 to 0.25 mm thick, which results in frames that are 0.2 mm to 0.25 mm thick. In this embodiment all of the arches on each frame are integral, or made from the same starting material. Frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b> have an annular configuration, as can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, even though they are not perfectly annular. Annular in this context refers to structures (e.g., atrial frames) that, once assembled as part of the expandable anchor, subtend 360 degrees around a longitudinal axis LA of the expandable frame. In other words, they are generally annular even though they are not perfectly annular. A longitudinal axis as used herein does not impart symmetry to the replacement heart valve, but generally refers to an axis that passes through a central portion of the central opening in the expandable anchor.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">In the manufacturing of the expandable anchor, atrial frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b>, once formed (e.g., cut), are secured to central portion <b>3</b>. In this embodiment there are twelve apertures <b>26</b> at one end of central portion <b>3</b>, as can be seen clearly in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>. Each of frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b> has six apertures <b>116</b> and <b>226</b>, respectively, and in this embodiment each one disposed in a valley of the frame between arches. To secure atrial frame <b>222</b> to central portion <b>3</b>, each aperture <b>226</b> is aligned with an aperture <b>26</b> in central portion, the relative positions of which can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref> shows frame <b>222</b> assembled to central portion <b>3</b> at a plurality of aligned apertures. In this embodiment frame <b>222</b> and central portion <b>3</b> are configured, including the location of the apertures, such that apertures <b>226</b> on frame <b>222</b> are aligned with alternating apertures <b>26</b> in central portion <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>. In this embodiment frame <b>222</b> and central portion <b>3</b> are secured together at the location of the aligned apertures by riveting the components together at the locations of the apertures. A rivet is placed through two aligned apertures, and then one side of the rivet is plastically deformed to secure the atrial frame to the central portion at the location of the aligned apertures.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">After frame <b>222</b> is secured to central portion <b>3</b> (which can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>), frame <b>122</b> is secured to central portion <b>3</b> in the same manner, except in this embodiment the six apertures <b>116</b> in frame <b>122</b> are first aligned with the six apertures <b>26</b> that are not yet riveted to frame <b>222</b> (the six “open” apertures <b>26</b> can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>). <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref> shows the expandable anchor after frame <b>122</b> is secured to central portion <b>3</b>, which in this embodiment is also done with rivets like frame <b>222</b>. Frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b> are rotationally offset with one another with respect to central portion (which can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>), and in this embodiment the peaks of one frame are rotationally aligned with a valley of the other frame. Frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b> overlap at frame sections between the valleys and peaks, and are in contact with one another where they overlap (but in other embodiments the memory configuration may be such that frame are slightly apart such that they do not contact one another where they overlap), which can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>. In this embodiment the frames overlap between the peaks and valleys. In this configuration arches <b>111</b> and <b>211</b> of the two frames are considered to be out of phase relative to one another, as can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>. For example, arches <b>111</b> can be approximately 30 degrees out of phase relative to arches <b>211</b>. That is, arches <b>111</b> of the first frame <b>122</b> can overlap with arches <b>211</b> of the second frame <b>222</b> such that, for example, a single arch <b>111</b> of the first outer frame <b>122</b> overlaps with half of two underlying arches <b>211</b> of the second outer frame <b>222</b>. In some embodiments, only some arches are out of phase with one another while other arches are in-phase with one another. When frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b> are secured to central portion <b>3</b>, the combination of overlapping frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b> can form a substantially circular, or annular, outer perimeter (in an end view of the device such as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>), which can provide a smooth surface to sit against the atrial tissue.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">Frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b> are secured to central portion <b>3</b>, but they are not directly attached to one another. This configuration allows for relative movement between frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b>. The relative movement around atrial anchor <b>2</b> may allow for atrial anchor <b>2</b> to conform better to the tissue on the atrial side of the annulus (there may be patient to patient variability) and help seal the expandable anchor in place better on the atrial side. For example, an arch <b>111</b> can be movable relative to the two arches <b>211</b> that it overlaps. That is, the outer perimeter of an arch <b>111</b> can flex in the direction of the longitudinal axis (axially) and/or translate relative to the two arches <b>211</b> that it overlaps, while the radially inner portions of the frames are secured to the central portion of the expandable anchor. The outer perimeter of the atrial anchor essentially creates a substantially circular, or annular, flexible seal whose arches can flex as needed relative to overlapping arches to better conform to the patient&#39;s anatomy and help create a better seal against atrial tissue.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">After atrial anchor <b>2</b> is attached to central portion <b>3</b> (shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>), the expandable anchor can be heat shaped again. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref> shows the expandable anchor (ventricular anchor <b>4</b> arches <b>42</b> can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>) after it is placed into a shaping fixture <b>303</b> and heated, such as at 915 degrees for 3 minutes, and then quenched in water to form the expandable anchor. The configuration of the expandable anchor after this shape setting step is shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, with reference numbers described above.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\">The exemplary expandable anchor shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, which is shown in an expanded memory configuration, has a ventricular anchor and an atrial anchor that are flared radially outward relative to the central portion such that the self-expandable anchor is configured to secure the replacement mitral valve to a mitral valve orifice in the self-expanded configuration. In this embodiment ventricular anchor <b>4</b>, which includes plurality of arches <b>42</b>, has a greater stiffness in the axial direction than the atrial anchor when the expandable anchor is in the expanded configuration. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates hypothetical axially forces “F” applied to the ventricular and atrial anchors, upon which ventricular anchor <b>4</b> has a greater resistance to deformation than atrial anchor <b>2</b>. The stiffness comparison is generally considered in response to a hypothetical applied force on the radially outer portions of the ventricular and atrial anchors, as shown by forces F in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">One aspect of the embodiment in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1-11B</figref> that contributes to the ventricular anchor being stiffer than the atrial anchor in an axially direction is that, in this embodiment, the arches in the ventricular anchor have a thickness that is greater than the thickness of each of atrial frames <b>122</b> and <b>222</b>, and thus the thickness of the arches in the two atrial frames. In this embodiment, however, the thickness of the atrial anchor at the location where the frames overlap is thicker than the thickness of the ventricular arches due to the double layer of material at the overlapping locations. In some merely exemplary embodiments the ventricular arches are 0.3 mm to 0.35 mm thick, which can be provided by cutting the ventricular anchor portion from a sheet of material that is 0.3 mm to 0.35 mm thick. In some embodiments the atrial anchor frames, and thus the arches, are 0.2 mm to 0.25 mm thick.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\">An additional aspect of the embodiment in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1-11B</figref> that contributes to the ventricular anchor being stiffer than the atrial anchor is that the ventricular anchor is formed integrally with the central portion, whereas the atrial anchor portion is made from different starting material and then attached to the central portion. While this embodiment includes two different frames in the atrial anchor portion, in some embodiments the atrial anchor includes only one of the frames. For example, in some alternate embodiments, there is only one atrial frame, which comprises a plurality of peaks and valleys. In these alternative embodiments, while there are not any overlapping arches and thus no relative movement between overlapping arches, the ventricular anchor is still stiffer than the atrial anchor, in part due to the points of attachment between the central portion and the atrial anchor, and because the ventricular anchor has thicker arches than the arches of the atrial anchor.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">In some alternative embodiments the ventricular anchor arches have the same thickness as the atrial arches, but the integral formation of the ventricular arches with the central portion can provide for the increased stiffness relative to the atrial arches. Additionally, even in designs where there is only one atrial anchor frame, the ventricular arches can have the same thickness as the atrial arches, and the greater stiffness of the ventricular arches is due at least partially to the integral formation of the ventricular anchor and the central portion.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">In alternative embodiments, the ventricular anchor, central portion, and atrial anchor (regardless of the number of atrial frames) are all integral, but the ventricular arches are thicker than the atrial arches. In one exemplary method of manufacturing, the entire anchor could be integral and cut from a tube, but the central and atrial portions could be ground down to have a smaller thickness than the ventricular portion. Thus even though the three portions of the expandable anchor are all integral, the ventricular side is still stiffer in the axial direction due at least partially due to the thicker ventricular arches.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">In some embodiments the ventricular portion, central portion, and atrial portion all have different thicknesses. For example, each of the three portions could be made from different starting materials (i.e., non-integral) with different thicknesses, and then secured together. Alternatively, the three portions could be integral and cut from a tube, and then one or more portion could be ground down to achieve a desired thickness in each portion, wherein the end result is that the three sections can have any desired thickness, such as three different thicknesses.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">Some of the increased flexibility (less stiff) of the atrial arches is also due to the length of the atrial arches (the linear distance between valleys of the atrial arches) compared to the lengths of the ventricular arches (the linear distances between valleys of the ventricular arches). Ventricular valley linear distance “VV” is shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, and atrial valley linear distance “AV” can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7A</figref>. In the embodiments shown herein the ventricular valley distance is less than the atrial valley distance (for both of the atrial frames in this embodiment).</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">In some embodiments the height of the ventricular arches “VH” (shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>), before the outward flare is imparted to the arches, is greater than VV. In some embodiments the two distances are substantially the same.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">The embodiment in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1-11B</figref> is also an example of a self-expandable anchor comprising a ventricular anchor integral with a central portion, and an atrial anchor secured to the central portion but not integral with the central portion. In this embodiment the expandable anchor (excluding the struts), when in an expanded configuration (which can be self-expandable) has a length L, which can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>. Midline, or half the length, is indicated as “M” in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>. In this embodiment the atrial anchor is disposed solely on the atrial side of the midline. That is, the atrial anchor portion is secured to the central portion on an atrial side of the expandable anchor. In this embodiment central portion <b>3</b> defines the radially innermost portion of the expandable anchor (excluding the struts and related structure).</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">In alternative embodiments the ventricular anchor can similarly be non-integral with the central portion and then secured thereto. For example, the ventricular anchor can comprise a ventricular annular frame (similar to an annular atrial frame) that is secured to the central portion, such as with rivets as described with respect to some atrial annular frames herein.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">In embodiments in which the atrial anchor is not integral with the rest of the anchor, and it secured to the rest of the anchor during manufacturing, the coupling between the atrial anchor and the rest of the expandable anchor can be movable or non-movable couplings. In some situations it may be desirable to have some degree of movement between the atrial anchor and the central portion at the location of the coupling(s). In some scenarios it may be desirable to limit as much motion as possible at the location of the couplings. For example, when rivets are used to secure the atrial anchor to the central portion, examples of which are provided herein, the riveting process can be tailored to accommodate the desired degree of movement between the riveted components. Too much movement between components due to the coupling could, however, lead to material fatigue and failure. Movable coupling as used herein can be thought of as hinge points between two components, or hinge locations. The hinge allows for some movement between the two components, which can enhance, for example, the atrial anchor conforming to atrial tissue. In addition, an expandable anchor that is constructed from more than one component coupled at rivets or hinges may flex freely at the couplings and reduce ultimate material strains.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">Any of the central portion, the ventricular and atrial anchor portions, and the struts can be formed from different starting materials from one another (i.e., non-integral). Non-integral components can, if desired, allow the various components to be of different flexibilities and stiffnesses, and it can also provide for radial overlapping (relative to the longitudinal axis of central opening) of the components. For example, described above, the atrial anchor can be configured to be more flexible (less stiff) than the ventricular anchor to provide better conformability and sealing in the atrium, while the stiffer ventricular anchor can provide sufficient resistance to pressure in the ventricle. In some embodiments, a thicker material can be used to form the central portion and the ventricular anchor while a thinner material can be used to form the atrial anchor. For example, the ventricular anchor can have a thickness of 0.25 mm to 0.35 mm while the atrial anchor can have a thickness of 0.15 mm to 0.25 mm. Further, in some embodiments, the length of the arches of the ventricular anchor (also referred to herein as the linear distance between valleys) can be shorter than the lengths of the arches of the atrial anchor to increase the stiffness of the ventricular anchor relative to the proximal anchor. For example, in some embodiments the arches of the atrial anchor are between 25 mm and 35 mm, such as approximately 30 mm long, while the length of the arches of the ventricular anchor are between 15 and 25 mm long, such as approximately 20 mm long.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">Rivets as used herein are an example of a coupler, as that term or derivatives thereof is used herein. The locations where components are secured to one another may be referred to as a coupling herein. Coupling also refers to the two components that are secured together. Riveting as used herein is an example of a method that plastically deforms a coupler to secure two or more components together at a coupling.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> show exemplary rivets that can be used to secure two or more components together herein (including the struts described below). Rivet <b>130</b> <i>a </i>as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref> is a stepped rivet and rivet <b>130</b> <i>b </i>as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13</figref> is a straight rivet. The rivets can be inserted through the apertures described herein and the second ends <b>135</b> and <b>137</b>, respectively, can then be plastically deformed using known riveting techniques to secure the two or more components together. The rivets can be made of a suitable implantable material, such as platinum, platinum-iridium alloy, tantalum, nickel-titanium alloy, or titanium and titanium alloys, such as titanium 6-4eli. In some embodiments, the riveted coupling can be such that one or more rivets are not tightened all the way down to the secured components, which allows for hinging of the coupling, if desired. Rivets used for hinging may be made of materials suitable for implantable bearing surfaces such as Nitronic 60 alloy, or nitinol. Hinge pins can be coated with low-friction, high-durability coatings, such as diamond-like coating, or titanium nitride. Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13</figref>, a stepped rivet can be used as a hinge pin. The stepped rivet can include a step, or change of diameter section <b>131</b>, such that one attached component can ride along a portion of the step. In some embodiments, hinge pins can be used to attach the atrial anchor, thereby providing more flexibility for the atrial anchor. Riveting and hinging can advantageously provide for better collapsing for delivery, including a smaller delivery profile, the advantages of which are described herein, such as for transseptal access to the mitral valve. Exemplary dimensions of rivets are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, in millimeters.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">Use of rivets and hinges (as opposed to, for example, crimp tubes) can provide an additional benefit of preventing cracking that can occur as single pieces of material flex and move. Additionally, rivets and hinges can provide various degrees of relevant movement between portions of the valve, which can allow the valve to be collapsed into a smaller delivery profile for delivery. The relative movement can also provide increased flexibility of the valve during delivery. Rivets can also allow for a variation in the relative orientation of the riveted components. In some embodiments, rivets provide increased flexibility that allows for greater trackability during delivery and better self-centering of the anchor against cardiac tissue (i.e., provides advantages for both access and conformability to the anatomy).</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\">The couplings herein (e.g., riveting) also allow different section of material with different physical properties to be secured to one another. This allows different sections of the expandable anchor to have different properties (e.g., stiffness) than other sections, as may be needed based on, for example, anatomical requirements. For example, atrial anchors can be made thinner than the central portion and/or ventricular anchors.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\">The prostheses herein also include a plurality of struts, to which are attached replacement leaflets, which are configured to control blood flow therethrough. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1 and 15</figref> are perspective views illustrating three struts <b>5</b> that are individually secured to central portion <b>3</b> of the expandable anchor, and are extending distally (towards the ventricular anchor). <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> is a view from the atrial side to the ventricular side, while <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref> is a view from the ventricular side to the atrial side. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates one of the three struts <b>5</b> in the embodiment in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1 and 12</figref>. In this exemplary embodiment three individual struts <b>5</b> are secured to central portion <b>3</b> at riveted couplings, in the same general manner as how the atrial anchor can be secured to the central portion, as described herein. Struts <b>5</b> have a ventricular end <b>59</b> and an atrial end <b>61</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>. Atrial end <b>61</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>57</b> <i>a</i>, <b>57</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>57</b> <i>c</i>, which are configured to be secured to apertures <b>36</b> in the central portion, such as using rivets or hinge pins as described herein. Struts <b>5</b> includes three elongate portions <b>55</b> <i>a</i>, <b>55</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>55</b> <i>c</i>, each extending from ventricular end <b>59</b> and each of which has a free end at the atrial end <b>61</b>. The free ends include the apertures <b>57</b> <i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. Elongate portion <b>55</b> <i>b </i>has a straight configuration, while elongate portions <b>55</b> <i>a </i>and <b>55</b> <i>c </i>are curved and flared outward relative to elongate portion <b>55</b> <i>b</i>. Struts <b>5</b> have a generally triangular configuration, pointing in the distal direction. The triangular struts <b>5</b> can provide vertical strength and lateral flexibility. Elongate portions <b>55</b> <i>a </i>and <b>55</b> <i>c </i>are curved and have a longer overall length than the middle straight elongate portion <b>55</b> <i>b </i>so as to provide an arched shape that lowers stress along the leaflets. Further, the atrial ends <b>61</b> of each outer elongate portion <b>55</b> <i>a </i>and <b>55</b> <i>c </i>can include a spring <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and <b>51</b> <i>c</i>, respectively, such as a clock spring, that is configured to compensate for the difference in lengths of elongate portions <b>55</b> <i>a</i>, <b>55</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>55</b> <i>c </i>when the prosthesis <b>1</b> is collapsed inwards into a collapsed configuration. The curved elongate portions <b>55</b> <i>a </i>and <b>55</b> <i>c </i>further include suture holes <b>53</b> and/or striations or bumps <b>56</b> along the outer perimeter to provide suture attachment points for the leaflets. The struts herein can be, for example, cut from flat metal sheet or tubing.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref> shows three struts <b>5</b> from <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref> coupled to central portion <b>3</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref> shows the subassembly from <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, but the view in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref> is from the ventricular side looking towards the atrial side.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\">As shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>, struts <b>5</b> are attached to central portion <b>3</b> with the struts extending distally. In some embodiments there can be three struts <b>5</b> located approximately 120 degrees away from one another around the circumference of the central portion. In other embodiments, the three strut legs may be located 90 degrees apart from each other with 30 degree gaps between the legs of adjacent three strut legs.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0082\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 16 and 2</figref>, in some embodiments, the valve prosthesis <b>1</b> can include valve leaflets <b>20</b> <i>a</i>, <b>20</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>20</b> <i>c </i>attached, such as sewn, to struts <b>5</b>. There can be three integral valve leaflets <b>20</b> <i>a</i>, <b>20</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>20</b> <i>c</i>, and the leaflets can form a pressure actuated valve that provides uni-directional flow occlusion when the prosthesis <b>1</b> is implanted in a valve orifice. The leaflets <b>20</b> <i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can be constructed of bio-materials, such as bovine or porcine pericardium, or polymer materials.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0083\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates central portion <b>4</b> comprising optional skirt <b>120</b> thereon or therearound formed of a biomaterial or thin polymer material. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary prosthesis <b>1</b> with leaflets <b>20</b> <i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, and skirt <b>120</b>. The skirt can advantageously help seal prosthesis <b>1</b> against the cardiac tissue when implanted. In some embodiments, the ventricular anchor can include a skirt in place of, or in addition to, the skirt <b>120</b> on central portion <b>3</b>. Additionally, a skirt can optionally be on the atrial anchor portion as well.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0084\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates an exemplary strut <b>70</b>. As shown in the embodiment of strut <b>70</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref>, a pin and slot mechanism (i.e., having an axially extending slot <b>83</b> along the middle elongate component <b>75</b> <i>b</i>), could be used to make up for the differences in the lengths of elongate portions <b>75</b> <i>a</i>-<i>c </i>during collapse.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0085\">Some central portions herein or other portions of other replacement heart valves may be susceptible to undesirable deforming when implanted, such as due to movement during the heartbeat and/or in response to pressures in the heart. In some embodiments the expandable anchor includes an annular strut frame coupled to a radially inner portion of the central portion (i.e., within the central portion). An annular strut frame may distribute forces more evenly over the central portion of the expandable anchor and may reduce the likelihood of undesirable central portion deformation once implanted.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0086\">An annular strut frame, if used, is an additional layer of material secured to the radially inner portion of the central portion, which reinforces and stabilizes the central portion when implanted. Additionally, by creating a coupling between the struts and the central portion (as opposed to having a solid portion of material that can provide additional stability), the flexibility of the coupling allows for relative movement of the struts during collapse of the device. This can reduce stresses on the device as it is collapsed, allowing for a smaller delivery profile, which as discussed herein can be important for delivery, such as a transseptal approach. The term annular in this context does not require a perfect annulus.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\">When the prosthesis includes a strut frame, the struts can either be integral to the strut frame or they can be separate components that are secured to the strut frame during manufacturing.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref> is a perspective view illustrating an exemplary annular strut frame <b>1000</b>. Strut frame <b>1000</b> includes frame portion <b>1002</b> and plurality of struts <b>1004</b>. Struts <b>1004</b> extend further distally (i.e., in the ventricular direction) than frame portion <b>1002</b>, and are configured to be secured to replacement leaflets as described herein. The strut frame <b>1000</b> has a ventricular end <b>1006</b> and an atrial end <b>1008</b>. Strut portion <b>1002</b> includes a plurality of arches, which define peaks <b>1012</b> and valleys <b>1014</b>. In this embodiment there are six strut frame arches, with two between adjacent struts <b>1004</b>. Struts <b>1004</b> have an arch configuration defined by first leg <b>1020</b> and second leg <b>1022</b>, each of which has a plurality of suture apertures <b>1018</b> therein. Struts <b>1004</b> each also have first and second extensions <b>1024</b> and <b>1026</b> extending away from legs <b>1020</b> and <b>1022</b> and towards atrial end <b>1008</b>. Extensions <b>1024</b> and <b>1026</b> may also be considered part of the frame portion rather than the struts. Replacement leaflets are secured to struts <b>1004</b> at holes <b>1018</b> (e.g., by suturing). The strut frame also includes a plurality of apertures <b>1010</b> near the atrial end <b>1008</b>, which are used to secure the annular strut frame to the central portion of the expandable anchor. The apertures are located at valleys <b>1014</b> in the frame portion. In some embodiments the annular strut frame is positioned radially within the central portion so that each of apertures <b>1010</b> is aligned with an aperture in the central portion, such as apertures <b>36</b>. A coupler (e.g., rivet) is then advanced through the aligned apertures and one side of the coupler is then plastically deformed to secure the annular strut frame to the central portion.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates an exemplary annular strut frame <b>1100</b>. Strut frame <b>1100</b> includes three struts <b>1104</b> and frame portion <b>1102</b>, which in this embodiment includes one arch between adjacent struts <b>1104</b>. Unlike the embodiment in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>, in which there is one coupling aperture <b>1010</b> within each strut, in this embodiment there are two apertures <b>1110</b> within each strut <b>1104</b>. Just as in the embodiment in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>, there are also apertures at the ends of each leg of struts. Strut frame <b>1100</b> is coupled to a central portion by aligning apertures <b>1110</b> with apertures in the central portion, such as aperture <b>36</b>, and then extending a coupler through each set of aligned apertures, and plastically deforming each coupler to secure the central portion to the annular strut frame at the locations of the couplings.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> illustrate exemplary strut frames in their expanded configurations, when the rest of the expandable anchor (e.g., ventricular anchor, central portion, and atrial anchor) is also in an expanded configuration. Strut frames <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> can be secured to, and considered part of, any of the expandable anchors herein.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\">In an exemplary method of manufacturing, the strut frame is cut from a tubular element, then expanded, and set in the expanded configuration using shape setting techniques described herein or otherwise known. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, the frame is cut from a 10 mm diameter tube, then expanded to an expanded configuration of about 32 mm (as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>), and set in the expanded configuration. In some exemplary embodiments the strut frames herein are 0.25 mm to about 0.45 mm thick, such as about 0.35 mm thick.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\">The annular strut frame can be cut from a flat sheet and rolled up and secured together (examples of which are described above), or it can be cut from a tubular structure.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> illustrate exemplary annular, or cylindrical, strut frames that are disposed radially within the central portion of the expandable anchor. The central portion and the strut frame can be thought of as creating a composite cylinder when they are coupled together. The composite cylinder is thicker than each of the central portion and strut frame individually. Each of the central portion and strut frame is, however, relatively thin and can flex with respect to the other component. The relative flexibility can make it easier to collapse into a delivery configuration. If the composite region were a single material with a thickness equivalent to the combined thickness of the central portion and strut frame, that modified region may not be able to collapse sufficiently to meet, for example, size constraints without overstraining. The central portion and strut frame acting as a composite structure will not overstrain when collapsed into a collapsed configuration since the central portion and strut frame can flex independently. The composite central portion and strut frame also, when the expandable anchor expands, has a thickness greater than each component individually, thus providing an increased thickness that may be needed to resist torquing and other forces on the central portion when implanted. The composite central portion and cylindrical strut frame thus enables collapsing as needed without overstraining, as well as provides a thickness to the central region that resists torquing and deformation due to forces acting on the expandable anchor when implanted.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\">In some embodiments various components of the prosthesis are described as being formed out of a flat sheet of material, but in some embodiments they can be formed out of a tubular element or other shape of material.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\">In some embodiments the configuration of the arches on the ventricular anchor portion might be the same as configuration shown herein (such as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>), but the ventricular anchor portion could be a separate frame that is secured to the central portion, just as some atrial anchors are secured to the central portion in exemplary embodiments herein. Both anchors can be separate components secured to central portion (not integral with central portion), and in some embodiments both ventricular and atrial anchors can be integral with the central portion.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\">In some embodiments, a prosthesis can include ventricular and atrial anchor portions that are both configured like anchor portion <b>2</b> herein. For example, both the ventricular and atrial anchor portions could be frames that are secured to the central portion. In some embodiments, a prosthesis can include ventricular and atrial anchor portions that are both configured like anchor portion <b>4</b> herein.</p>\\\\n    <p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0097\">The prostheses herein can be configured to self-expand within a cardiac valve orifice such that the central portion lines the valve orifice while the atrial and ventricular anchors sit within the chambers of the heart and pinch tissue of the orifice therebetween, securing the prosthesis in place.
